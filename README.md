# Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wishes to create a web-based game utilizing a server-client framework in which users compete to guess pictures as they are being drawn. They want me to design a web-based game.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel that I articulated the differences between the operating systems well, and explained the technical aspects of the game sufficiently.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I personally found UML documentation to be extremely helpful, as its simple, visual nature kept kept me focused on what exact specifications I need to implement.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would likely revise the first section. I think I could make it more eloquent as well as more accurately and specifically describe my client's wishes.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are paramount when designing software. If users do not like the software, it has no hope of succeeding. I always considered how design changes may affect the user experience.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When I thought about how to design software, I deeply considered the specifics of its utility, its portability, and its relationship with the operating platform as a whole.
